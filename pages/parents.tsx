                            NGL is a fresh take on anonymity. Users post their ‚ÄúNGL link‚Äù on an Instagram story, and their followers can send anonymous messages to their NGL inbox in the app. We believe anonymity should provide a fun yet safe place to express your feelings and opinions without shame or judgement. In the current realm of social media, young people don‚Äôt have a space to share their feelings without judgement from friends or societal pressures. NGL provides this safe space for teens.

                            ‚ÄçSocial media has become dangerously inauthentic. Though the medium began as a way to allow people to publicly share their thoughts, feelings, and lives, it has recently become a contest of who can make their life seem the most perfect. NGL aims to strip away this veneer of inauthenticity and replace it with the freedom of anonymity, allowing our users to express themselves freely and truthfully without fear of judgement. If your child is using NGL, we promise that it‚Äôs not just another social media app cluttering up their phone; it‚Äôs a new means of expression for your child‚Äôs thoughts and feelings.

                            2. Report the message to the NGL team - Reporting the message in the app allows us to improve our moderation system by identifying harmful words and sentiments, while also strengthening our community by identifying potentially harmful users.

                            <br/><br/>
                            3. Delete the app for a few days - Sometimes, a break is necessary to properly recover. Help your child take appropriate action to recover from bullying.

                            4. Get help - Recovering from bullying is a daunting task, and it‚Äôs okay to ask for help throughout you or your child‚Äôs recovery.
